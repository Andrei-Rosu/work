# Showcase

My portfolio. Built with React.

## Dev

```sh
yarn install
yarn start
```

## Making it your own

Edit [src/data/projects.js](src/data/projects.js) to customize the projects that are being displayed. 
That file contains a simple JavaScript JSON Object so it should be very easy to get started.


## Libraries Used

```sh
React
React-Router
Redux
GeoPattern
```

## Deployment

Run `yarn build` to generate bundle files with all the dependencies.
 
Then use the `deploy.sh` script to deploy them to `gh-pages` branch.

This is my first React project. I was only able to complete it because of these resources.
